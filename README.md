###### Click on "start.bat" to run the script and start the server
###### Wait until the line "Done!" is appeared

###### Current Problem:
###### - AutoSaveWorld Plugin is not functioning properly, but still be able to save automatically without malfunctioning;
###### - Pop up messages "Is the server lag?" shows the delay of server response, possibly due to the bad hardware performance
######   no need to be worried about the message, not affecting the gaming experience at all

###### After starting the server, go to "whatismyip.com" to check for ip and share it to your friends! :)
###### For the server master/admin, type in "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" in multiplayer's ip

###### Have Fun!
